    "# Life Expectancy Around the World\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "### Team 3: Yongpeng Fu, Jacques Botha, Somnath Bhattacharjee\n",
    "The subject matter of our group project is “life expectancy.”  Life expectancy can be defined as “the average age that members of a particular population group will be when they die” [1]. This is an interesting subject to us and to many others for a multitude of reasons. Life expectancy is considered a key metric that is commonly used in assessing the health of a population, it can vary significantly from one population to the next, it has doubled over the last century [2] and there are numerous factors that influence it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our group hopes to answer the following primary guiding questions.\n",
    "* How has the life expectancy changed globally over time?\n",
    "* What is the years lived with disability vs. Health expenditure per capita?\n",
    "* What sort of relationship exists between Life Expectancy and GDP per capita?\n",
    "* What sort of relationship exists between Life Expectancy and Healthcare expenditure per capita?\n",
    "* Which factor, GDP per capita or Healthcare expenditure per capita appears to have a stronger relationship with Life Exepctancy?\n",
    "* How gender gap life expectancy varies between Men and Women in US and Canada?\n",
    "* What is the change in gender survival rates year-to-year in Canada?\n",
    "* What is the average survival rates before and after 2000 for Men and Women in US and Canada?\n",
    "* For which years was the death count at its maximum in US and Canada for the age groups under 5 and age 5 to 14?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "We believe our guiding questions are those that are of interest to not only us but to many others. The answers to these questions may be able to provide some valuable insights as towards how people should choose to live their lives if they were to try to maximize their life expectancy. Understanding how your life choices with respect to where a person chooses to live, what a person chooses to consume, how a person chooses to utilize modern medicine or technology etc. These are all factors that we expect to play a significant role in shaping a populations life expectancy.\n",

    "## DataSet\n",
    "\n",
    "Our datasets were mainly obtained from Our World in Data [3]. Our World in Data is a scientific online publication that focuses on large global problems such as poverty, disease, hunger, climate change or even war. This is a very trustworthy place to pull the data from because its publications have been cited by renowned academic scientific journals, The Washington Post, The New York Times, and The Economist. For our project, we are using their data source because it provides a big picture for the life expectancy change around the world. All the data sets obtained from Our World in Data are completely open access under the Creative Commons BY license [4]. Under this license, the data provider grants us permission to copy, modify and publish the information for our course project.\n",
    " \n",
    "Most of the datasets we gathered are organized in a tabular format unless otherwise indicated. The main csv table we will be using is named “life-expectancy.csv”. The table has 4 features including `Entity`, `Code`, `Year`, and `Life expectancy`, with 19209 records. The Entity and associated Code, on the country-, regional- and global-level, are entries for the record. The year feature has a time span from 1543 to 2019, which in combination with Code are important keys for us to join with other tables. The life expectancy at birth is of particular interest to us, which is described as the average number of years that a newborn could expect to live if he or she were to pass through life subject to the age-specific mortality rates of a given period. The whole dataset was compiled based on different sources [5-6]. And the total size of this table is about 500kb. Moreover, additional tables and their dominated features were used to answer particular guiding questions as follows:\n",

    "## Yongpeng Fu: The Impact of Disability or Disease on Life Expectancy\n",
    "Since the first industrial revolution in the early 19th centry, life expectancy has been seen a dramatic increase. However, high inequality in how health was distributed across the world is persistent. Rich countries or regions have a relatively less inequality than the poor ones. This discrepancy is amplified more between healthy people and people with disability or health conditions. It is reported that people with disability in activities of daily living or health issue had a 10-year sohrter life expectancy than nondisabled people [8]. In this section, I will be mainly using three datasets (the cell description right after) to address the following overarching questions:\n",
    "* How has the life expectancy changed globally over time?\n",
    "* How has healthy life expectancy changed over time?\n",
    "* what is the years lived with disability vs. Health expenditure per capita?"

    "## Data Wrangling\n",
    "Before I push them into the database or do any join between them, I will need to do some data wrangling to make sure data is consistency and intact. There are three things to be fixed.\n",
    "* One is the discrepancy between `Entity` and `Code`. The Code is ISO codes as described in the ISO 3166 international standard [9]. These codes are used throughout the IT industry by computer systems and software to ease the identification of country names. All three tables are missing some Codes for the Entity. An Entity can be a country name or a continent name. It is the continent name missing a Code name, which is not a surprise since it just does not exist. However, in our case, we want to enforce an uniform Code name as \"continent_name\" for all the Continent because we do not want have NA values in the final table, which is known to cause potential ptoblem in query down the road. Also, enforcing a consistent label for any Continent would make our filter easy down the road.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Another one is the missing value for `Continent` in disability_vs_health_expenditure_per_capita table. One continent is composed of many counties or regions. To save file size, the original table only provides one continent entry for all the countries or regions in the same continent. I will need fill up the gap for all records.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Last thing to fix is the column name. I noticed that some column name is too long, which is a problem when I write the data records into Database. As such I will also trim the column name when needed.\n"

    "## <a name='Question1'> Question 1: Life Expectancy Rising Globally Over Time\n",
    "Before I dive into how life expectancy has changed under different health-related conditions, I am curious to see what is the overall change for life expectancy, which I believe is a better indicator for the global health. Life expectancy is reported to have a significant increase since the Age of Enlightenment, but the inequality in how health is distributed across the world has also been enlarged since then. In this section, I will explore timeseries change for life expectancy in the most recent 30 years since 1990 to 2019, and the difference in life expectancy when it comes to different countries or regions across the world.\n",
    "\n",
    "Results:\n",
    "* In our dataset, UK has the logest time-series record dated back to 1543. However it was until 1770 the World data record was started. Although the year is not continuous all the time, we do see steady increase in the life_expectancy column. It started with 28 years all the way to 72 years, which is more than 40 years increase. To make a comparison, YearIncrease is generated by subtracting the first row of life expectancy in 1770 from each year follows. This column is more obvious that there is no big change for life expectancy from 18th to the beginning of 20th century. The biggest change was observed in 20th century where about 5-10 years were added for each quater of the century. In the first 20 years of 21 century up to 2019, about 6 years of life expectancy has been added on top of 20th century. It wont be too much surprised to see longer life expectancy further on the road, although a plateau effect is showing up.  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* The world had a long time with low life expectancy of 30 years in all regions before modern society. In history, infectious diseases raged in all parts of the world. Children could die way before they had the chance to reach adulthood without public health measures and effiective medicines. It was until recently for humanity to see a substantial increase of life expectancy. However, different regions began to see this substantial increase (more than 10%) at different times. For example, Oceania began to see increases in life expectancy around 1870, while Africa didn’t begin to see increase until around 1920.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* In 2019, the life expectancy in the top 10 countries or regions is over 83 years compared to the global average life expectancy of 72 years. The top 4 are Monaco (86.751), San Marino (84.972), Hong Kong (84.857) and Japan (84.629). In contrast, the life expectancy in the bottom 10 countries or regions is between 50 and 60 years, more than 10 years less than the global average. The population of the Central African Republic has the lowest life expectancy in 2019 with 53 years.  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* However, we do see a decrease in the health inequality between the top and bottom countries or regions. As an example, the life expectancy change between 2019 and 1990 (the past 30 years) is calculated and compared. The absolute change for most of the top 10 countries or regions is equal or less than the global change (8.4 years and 11.57%). In contrast, although it is not very consistent, absolute change for more than half of the bottom 10 countries or regions is greater than the global change. In addition, the effect is more significant when we look at the relative change in percentage. Having said that, we need to note that Lesotho not being improved at all is a concern given its life expectancy is already on the low end."

    "## <a name='Question2'>Question 2: Expected Years of Living with Disability or Disease Burden is longer than ever\n",
    "As shown in [Question 1](#Question1), the overall life expectancy has been rising globally. Now I want to dissect total life expectancy into 'healthy life expectancy' and 'years lived with disability'. Expected Years of Living with Disability or Disease Burden is defined as the difference between total and healthy life expectancy. Years lived with disability is becoming increasingly common in the field of public health and health impact assessment, because population-level health is crucial for evidence-informed policy. In the following, I investigated how has healthy vs. non-healthy life expectancy changed over time.\n",
    "\n",
    "* From the the results of global healthy and non-healthy life expectancy, we see that both life expectancy have increased across the world. The increase of healthy life expectancy is not a big surprice. What is more interesting is the life expectancy with disability or disease burden has also increased, albeit not as fast as healthy life expecancy (compared the columns of healthy_diff and disability_diff). This is a result from improved healthcare and treatments in human history, especially in recent decades. \n",
    "* When we look at the \"Years lived with disability vs. healthcare expenditure in 2014\", we can see a positive relationship between lived with disability or disease burden versus average per capita health expenditure. The reason I only focused on 2014 is because this is year the most counties or regions have the record for healthcare expenditure. The rank of both column tells us that countries with higher healthcare expenditure tend to live more years with disability or disease burden. This is likely to result from increased healthcare resourcing in general care and treatment (allowing for an extension of life with a given illness or disability).\n",
    "* Althought it is indicative that healthy life expectancy is also benefiting from higher average health expenditure per capita, I want to double comfirm this conclusion with actual comparison. To do so, I have to join life_expectancy_disability with disability_vs_health_expenditure_per_capita, because healthy_life_expectancy sits in life_expectancy_disability table, while health_expenditure_per_capita sits in disability_vs_health_expenditure_per_capita table. Since there is no primary key for both tables, I manually created primary key for them by combining Entity+Year as composite primary key. The result clearly shows the positive association between healthy life expectancy and the health spendings. Most of the countries or regions have the same pattern in both Years lived with disability or health life vs. healthcare expenditure, but not for United States. In the pattern of \"Years lived with disability vs. healthcare expenditure in 2014\", US is ranking number 1 in health_expenditure_per_capita, and also achieves high rank of number 11 in years_lived_disability. However, in the pattern of \"Years lived with healthy life vs. healthcare expenditure in 2014\", although US is still ranking number 1 in health_expenditure_per_capita, but the rank_years_healthy_years is number 44 lying in the middle. It is odd that US has spent the highest health expenditure of any country in the world, but only gains a relatively short healthy life expectancy."

    "## <a name='Question3/4'>Question 3/4: What sort of relationship exists between Life Expectancy and GDP per capita and Life Expectancy and Healthcare expenditure per capita?\n",
    "    \n",
    "In creating SQL queries where I was able to rank the countries for each `year` between 1950 and 2019 with respect to `life expectancy` and `GDP per capita` and `healthcare expenditure per capita` it becomes very evident that there is a significant positive relationship. \n",
    "    \n",
    "That is to say that countries with higher GDP per capita and Healthcare expenditure per capita tend to have higher life expectancies than countries with lower GDP per capita and Healthcare expenditure per capita. This can be confirmed when we compare the top 10 and top 5 percentile ranks for each year between 1950 and 2019 and can see that the countries with highest life expectancy typically also are in the upper echelon of countries with respect to GDP per capita and Healthcare expenditure per capita. Likewise, we can also confirm this when we view the bottom 10 and bottom 5 percentile of countries with respect to life expectancies.\n",
    "\n",
    "## <a name='Question5'>Question 5: Which factor, GDP per capita or Healthcare expenditure per capita appears to have a stronger relationship with Life Expectancy?\n",
    "\n",
    "In looking at the `year over year` changes in `GDP per capita` and `healthcare expenditure per capita` vs `life expectancy`, it is difficult to quantify the effect of these factors on each country’s life expectancy. For example, a year that shows a large increase in GDP per capita or healthcare expenditure is not met with a significant increase in life expectancy. Instead, life expectancy has generally been trending upwards for all countries even in periods of decreasing GDP per capita and healthcare expenditure per capita.\n",
    "    \n",
    "As previously mentioned, one possible explanation for this global increasing trend in life expectancy is a reduction in the number of deaths due to the eradication of disease thanks to vaccines. I also feel that advances in modern medicine for things such as the treatment of diseases with respect to things such as cancers have also played a large role. In addition to advances in modern medicine, it is safe to assume that the accessibility or increases in infrastructure such as hospitals or doctors has also played a large role in this trend. Unfortunately, we are unable to quantity these factors with the data sets we have chosen as a group.\n",
    "    \n",
    "However, in the earlier years `life expectancy` and `healthcare expenditure`, `GDP per capita` both show similar relationships when we view it in terms of rankings in the top 10 or percentiles. We can see that in the earlier years we see approximately a similar number and ranking of countries with respect to GDP per capita and healthcare expenditure per capita fall within the top 10 or top 5 percentile with respect to life expectancy. However, as time passes GDP per capita does not seem to be as strong of an indicator of life expectancy whereas healthcare expenditure remains consistent.\n"

    "In the 1920s, a pattern began to emerge in the health and mortality of men and women. These observations prompted a great deal of research, construing the phenomenon as the “gender and health paradox,” [11]. \n",
    "\n",
    "Several hypotheses  to explain the paradox have been proposed. **Two of the most pervasive** provide coherent explanations based on the association between health and mortality. \n",
    "\n",
    "According to the **first hypothesis**, as a consequence of interactions among biological, social, psychological and behavioural factors[12], men and women suffer from different types of illnesses. Women report health problems more frequently, but these conditions tend to be less severe and lethal than those from which men tend to suffer[13-15]. \n",
    "According to the **second hypothesis**, women, on average, live longer, a gap that translates into health inequalities between men and women. Previous work has found that women’s longer lives are accompanied by increases in morbidity, and has concluded that women’s longevity advantage itself is an important contributor to their health disadvantage[16-18].\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In this section, We will be mainly using three datasets to address the following guing questions\n",
    "* How gender gap varies between Men and Women in US and Canada?\n",
    "* Change in gender survival year-to-year in Canada?\n",
    "* Average survival before and after 2000 for Men and Women in US and Canada?\n",
    "* Which year was the death count at its maximum in US and Canada for the age groups under 5 and age 5 to 14?"

    "## Jacques Botha - What is the relation between Life Expectancy, Healthcare expenditure per capita and various risk factors that result in death? \n",
    "\n",
    "In order to evaluate the relationship between Life Expectancy, Healthcare expenditure per capita and various risk factors associated with deaths, I created a merged data set from the following data sets; `life_expectancy_vs_healthcare_expenditure` and the `number_of_deaths_by_risk_factor`. I chose to evaluate two years that appeared to have the most data available for all countries, 2000 and 2014.\n",
    "\n",
    "I then ranked the `Life Expectancy`, `Healthcare expenditure per capita` and the following risk factors; `high blood pressure`, `alcohol use`, `smoking`, `high body mass index` and `drug use` in order to get a better idea of how these factors relate to countries with high life expectancy, healthcare expenditure per capita and low life expectancy, healthcare expenditure per capita.\n",
    "\n",
    "In reviewing the results, we can see that most countries in the top 10 with respect to life expectancy also place quite high with respect to annual deaths caused by the risk factors I have choose to include in my analyses. Even though from our previous analysis, and again here, we can see that countries with higher life expectancy typically have higher healthcare expenditure per capita, they still place quite high in terms of annual deaths with respect to `high blood pressure`, `alcohol use`, `smoking`, `high body mass index` and `drug use`.  \n",
    "\n",
    "One possible explanation of this phenomena is that the countries that place in the top 10 with respect to Life Expectancy also tend to have higher GDP per capita (which has also been demonstrated in previous analysis). A reasonable conclusion to draw from this is the people of these countries are also afforded the luxury of things such as alcohol, cigarettes or drugs or poor dietary choices such as \"junk\" food. Hence, people are more likely to abuse these items which could result in higher casualties than countries with lower GDP per capita who may not be able to afford them.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another possible explanation is that the countries that rank lower in terms of life expectancy, healthcare expenditure per capita may be more vulnerable to other factors that result in death due to lack of the very basic healthcare services. Factors that can cause death such as diseases that can be treated with vaccines, clean water or sanitation practices for which the countries are unable to provide its citizens."

    "## Yongpeng Fu - What is the relation between years_lived_with_disability and GDP_per_capita? \n",
    "To answer this question, I will be joining two datasets, first \"disability_vs_health_expenditure_per_capita\" and second \"life_expectancy_vs_gdp_per_capita\". Years_lived_with_disability sits in the first table and GDP_per_capita sits in the second table. The reason this question is interesting to me is because the relation between years_lived_with_disability and GDP_per_capita can complement my primary inquiry about \"The Impact of Disability or Disease on Life Expectancy\". From [Question 2_Yongpeng Fu](#Question2), we have learnt Years lived with disability or disease burden has a positive association with average per capita health expenditure. However, in some countries, average per capita health expenditure is not as readily available as overall GDP. As such, it is more significant to use overall GDP or GDP per capita as an indicative for population health, in our case is years_lived_with_disability. From [Jacques Conclusion](#JacConclusion), we have learnt another fact that countries with higher GDP per capita tend to have higher life expectancies, but the the association between GDP per capita vs. years_lived_with_disability is unknown. After running some queries, we can see the following predominant result:\n",
    "* As the GDP_per_capita (or the rank_GDP_per_capita) decreases, the years_lived_with_disability (or rank_years_lived_with_disability) goes down as well in general. This observation further confirmes our conclusion that countries with higher GDP tend to have a higher life expectancy and higher years lived with disability, indicating GDP per capita can be used as an indicator for predicting how long a person can live with disability or disease burden. However, we also noticed a few outliers that do not follow the trend. For example, Norway, United Arab Emirates and Equatorial Guinea have really high GDP_per_capital but their years_lived_with_disability is not ranking very top. This may indicate that economic development cannot be the sole determinant of disability improvement. Other factors like culture and education may also play an important role. Due the time constraint and limited data source we had, we are not exploring further.\n"

    "# Conclusion\n",
    "This project starts off talking about overall life expectancy change on the global level, followed by life expectancy division into healthy and life with disability parts. In the next section, the relationship between the Life Expectancy and GDP per capita and Healthcare Expenditure per capita were investigated. Finally, a comparion between genders for life expectancy was made. We revealed many interesting findings, as stated in the following conclusion.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Section one: The Impact of Disability or Disease on Life Expectancy.\n",
    "    * Life Expectancy has been steadily rising globally since 1770, despite difference between regions and countries.\n",
    "    * A positive relationship exists with respect to years lived with disability vs. Health expenditure per capita. That is to say that countries with higher healthcare expenditure tend to live more years with disability or disease burden. This is likely to result from increased healthcare resourcing in general care and treatment\n",
    "    * Healthy life expectancy has also been benefitting from increased health expenditure and GDP per capita.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Section two:  The relationship between GDP per Capita and Healthcare Expenditure per Capita vs Life Expectancy\n",
    "    * Countries with higher GDP per capita tend to have higher life expectancies than countries with lower GDP per capita.\n",
    "    * For the same reason that those living with disabilities have benefited with respect to living longer with diseases in countries that have Healthcare expenditure per capita when can also assume that those who do not have diseases have also benefited from increased Healthcare expenditure per capita due to an increase in general care and treatment.\n",
    "    * It is difficult to quantify the effect of these factors on each country’s life expectancy, however, overtime it has become more apparent that healthcare expenditure per capita may be the better measuring stick to use in order to gauge a countries life expectancy.\n",
    "    * The factors that cause deaths vary significantly from not only country to country but also based on life expectancy. We see that countries that consistently rank in the top vs the countries that consistently rank in the bottom tier with respect to life expectancy tend to have significant differences when we look at the factors that result in deaths each year.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Section three: Gender Gap in Life Expectancy\n",
    "    * The result shows that since the year 1960 the life expectancy of Men and Women have a positive slope of growth in US and Canada.\n",
    "    * Considering the gender, year to year difference is more in case of Women than Men in US and Canada. \n",
    "    * The survivals of Men and Women before and after 2000 shows significant increase in life expectancy. In both the countries the life expectancy jumped by around 10 years for both Men and Women.\n",
    "    * The year 1990 was the year of maximum death count for age group less than five. For age 5 to 14 the year was not captured in the available dataset. "

    "## Future Direction\n",
    "\n",
    "A good future direction for our project is a deeper analysis with respect to life expectancy for various age groups. As suggested by one of our classmates there is potential for bias among first world countries that may skew overall life expectancy due to a higher infant mortality rate due to lack of basic healthcare.\n",
    "\n",
    "Further analysis into the leading causes of death in countries would also be very telling as to what sort of specific factors such as disease, sanitation, etc. would be very helpful in determining how life expectancy is shaped in these countries.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another direction we could also take is to look at countries that have private healthcare systems and compare their disposable incomes with average medical costs and compare these countries life expectancies with countries that have public healthcare. I think the analysis here could further support reasons why GDP per capita may not now be such a strong indicator of life expectancy vs Healthcare expenditure per capita.\n"
